# Running locally

First of all, you have to be sure you have node >= 6.x installed and npm >= 4.0, than run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
git clone https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/angular-image-feed
cd angular-image-feed
npm install
ng serve --open
```
The most recent ng cli version at the article creation moment was 1.1.3.
